As a Sr. Product Data Analyst, you'll be directly impacting our results through insights and reports. You'll be working close to product managers, researchers, and other business stakeholders, helping with prioritization, assessments, and business recommendations. It will be your responsibility, alongside the Analytics team, to nurture the data-driven culture within the company, making data easier to consume, be it through interactive reports, easy-to-use datasets, documentation, training.
Help Us Build the Future of Outdoor Services
At LawnStarter, we’re transforming the $100B+ outdoor home services industry—making it easier for homeowners to book, manage, and enjoy services like lawn care, landscaping, and more. With $30M+ in venture funding and solid traction, we’re investing in the next generation of our platform—and we’re looking for a Senior Product Data Analyst to help drive it.
📹 See what we are building!
Problems to be solved
Your primary responsibility will be to empower our organization to be more data-driven, and there are many ways to accomplish that, such as:
Modeling & Analysis: A marketplace is a complex system, with various moving parts and often contradicting signals. That creates an extremely exciting pool of opportunities to find gaps, insights, or optimizations. The analysis and models we need have different degrees of complexity, from simple AB tests to multivariate models on retention or ETA. We expect you to have advanced experience in SQL and intermediate experience in Python or R.
Reporting: If a complex system creates an exciting pool of opportunities, it also creates a high number of metrics that we need to keep track of to run the business efficiently. However, a dashboard is only as good as our trust in being correct and updated. It’s your responsibility to understand the needs of the teams you’ll be working with and help the Analytics team create and maintain our reporting system, keeping it organized and user-friendly. For that, you’ll be mainly using Tableau and Metabase.
Analytics Engineering: Although it won’t be your main focus, occasionally, you will need to work on the inner layers of our Data Warehouse to provide clean and documented datasets to empower our reports and end users within the organization. Understanding the business needs and consolidating them into our DW is crucial to maintaining a reliable single source of truth. We use DBT for the data transformation, so SQL experience is a must.
Requirements
Experience: You have 4+ years of experience in data & analytics at data-driven companies.
Education: You have a STEM or business background or relevant education that makes you suited to empower our organization to be more data-driven.
Learning Mindset: You take pride in understanding problems deeply and asking the right questions. You can absorb a variety of topics with extreme ease, having a structured and logical approach to developing your understanding of the business and its challenges. This is unlikely to be a good fit if you have a preconceived system of processes and methods and plan on just applying them without first learning all the ways our business is unique.
Team player: You are ready to work alongside exceptional people, helping them achieve great results. You create an environment where people are excited to work with you daily, with intellectual honesty and trust.
Business focus: You care deeply about understanding business needs and how your analysis connects with our product, customers, and financials. You can envision how metrics drill down from the highest to the lowest level, identifying what needs to be analyzed or reported on each.
Bias for action: You understand that despite your careful approach to understanding problems and identifying opportunities, you actively try to avoid being a perfectionist or getting yourself tied up in knots. You have a bias for action in order to make progress. You enjoy being scrappy and constraints enthrall you. This is unlikely to be a good fit if you, by default, like building full solutions from the get-go.
VERY IMPORTANT REMINDER: Please upload your English resume—applications without it will not be considered.

At http://realtor.com , we have the most comprehensive and accurate coverage of real estate listings and the most engaged users across all the online real estate portals. Our mission is to make buying, selling, renting, and living in homes easier and more rewarding for everyone.
The Data Science and Analytics organization at http://realtor.com sits at the heart of this mission. We process and analyze terabytes of data every day that enable decisions for millions of home buyers, sellers, renters, dreamers, and real estate professionals. Our goal is to use this data to make the home buying experience a breeze for our consumers. We empower them with the most up-to-date information on properties, help them find their dream homes in the least amount of time, and match them with the most suitable realtor to meet their unique, individual needs.
Role Description:
We are looking for the best data and analytical minds to help us measure the effectiveness of our products that aim to make it simple and easy to buy and sell a home. To accomplish that task, we are looking for a Senior Data Analyst with a consumer services, business, or technology background to join our expanding Product Analytics team within the Enterprise Data Science and Analytics organization.

Create a rich understanding of how people are interacting with product features and use these insights to then make recommendations.
Opportunity Identification and Sizing: Both to set goals and help evaluate potential product enrichment opportunities, you will be tasked with forecasting and opportunity sizing. This will help our Product stakeholders understand the short-run and long-run dynamics of proposed changes to our product strategy, and create targets for driving business performance as well as optimize lead generation and funnel improvement opportunities.
Partnership and Communication: Partner closely with our Product stakeholders to identify and unlock opportunities, and with other data teams to improve platform capabilities around data architecture, data visualization, data modeling, and testing platforms.
Build trust in all interactions and with Enterprise Consumer Data Mart and be an advocate for adoption

We’re building the next generation of recruiting software and we’re starting with a suite of products that helps talent leaders, recruiters, and hiring managers run an efficient and data-driven hiring process.
We are well-funded and backed by great investors, including Y Combinator, Elad Gil and Lachy Groom. We have over 1,500 amazing customers including Ramp, Notion, OpenAI and Zapier – yet we've only taken the first steps toward a much larger opportunity. In short, it's the perfect time to join! 🚀
About this Role
👋 Hi, I’m Kevin, I manage the data team and analytics products at Ashby. With Ashby’s ongoing growth we’re entering a new phase where the role of data will become more important than ever before. With that in mind, I’m looking for a talented data analyst to join our dynamic team!
As a Data Analyst at Ashby you’ll primarily be focused on product-related analytical questions. This will cover the gamut of most standard analyses and related assets (analysis summaries, metric monitoring, dashboards, etc). Given Ashby is well-positioned to capture global recruiting data, our product analyses naturally lend themselves to global job market benchmark reports which are highly valuable to Ashby and the broader employer and candidate job markets (see our Talent Trends for some examples).
Your responsibilities will cover the whole data funnel: starting from raw or lightly modeled data all the way through final analysis summary. When appropriate, you will be responsible for analysis work that becomes standardized internal dashboards for other Ashby team members. All in, you will have broad analytical ownership and responsibilities, so this is a role best fit for a curious and ambitious type that enjoys touching the whole data analysis ecosystem.
If you are a product-minded analyst, given Ashby supports a whole recruiting analytics product offering, there is a very real potential that your internal analysis work could contribute directly to our product roadmap. This is not a requirement, but I see it as a genuinely likely possibility and an added bonus.
Data Culture at Ashby
At Ashby, we draw a clear distinction between when to look to data for ""the answer"" and when to use data to aid principled thinking for decision making. In general, a primary consideration is whether or not data is needed to help clarify points of uncertainty. When data is considered necessary, a secondary consideration is to what depth data will be required. Data questions lend themselves to ongoing ""what about..."" or ""what if..."" explorations, which can be important in some situations but are not always necessary.
With these dynamics in mind, we do not foster an environment where every decision we make should be backed by data, but we do foster an environment where teammates ask whether or not data will fit the task at hand well. This, in turn, allows us to operate a lean team focused on projects where data provides true leverage to our overall business and product goals.
As a related but distinct point, Ashby’s data culture, as far as transparency and access goes, is very open. We share company-wide access to our financial standings, progress, goals, and generally make any data and reporting results broadly available. Outside of constraints related to whether a teammate has access to a particular tool, there are close to no constraints on access the state of the company as told by data or reporting. In general, we would like to continue and extend open access to data throughout the company (with your help!), but with consideration and not as a substitute for principled thinking :)
Requirements
The essence of this role dictates that you must be analytical, conversant in statistical reasoning, and capable of managing the data you work with from inception through synthesis of results in the appropriate downstream assets. There are a lot of ways to meet those responsibilities. If the dot product of your skill vector with this requirements vector is close to 1, please consider applying, but please note it does not have to be 1.0.
Expertise in SQL-based data analysis
Strong in analytical and statistical thinking - you must be able to generate insights
Expertise with data visualization (i.e. visual communication of results)
Interest in working directly with business partners, e.g. product or go-to-market teammates, to identify and plan related analysis efforts
Proficiency building internal “data products” based on your analysis results, e.g. high-usage dashboards via BI tools (Looker, Tableau, etc) for various business partners
Excellent written and verbal communication. Ashby has a writing-centric culture, but you will also be responsible for direct collaboration with various teammates
Very detail-oriented: in your analysis work you can anticipate complications and identify bad-but-not-obviously-wrong data discrepancies
Proficiency in Python (primarily in the domain of data analysis and visualization)
Experience in modeling and working with product analytics events
You could be a great fit if
You identify as exceptionally curious by nature
You could pass as an “analytics engineer” or have working proficiency in dbt-based data modeling
You have been a first or early data analyst at a growing, fast-moving startup
You have working experience in B2B SaaS and understand how analysis facilitates business success
You have an intuition for solving problems pragmatically and an eye for leverage
You enjoy collaboration and find reward in enabling other teammates to succeed
You have strong, experience-backed opinions about data products and data culture in a company setting
Familiarity with our data stack is a bonus, but not a requirement
Have a passion for refining the role of data within company environments, spanning everything from communication standards and data request management - you’ll help shape this as Ashby grows
You can appreciate the whole distribution as much as a point estimator
Reasons not to apply
You do not enjoy working directly with non-analysts or other business stakeholders. This role will require working closely with teammates across the company as various data-related needs come up.
You are looking for consumer-scale data infrastructure projects. We have a huge and interesting set of data to work with (check out our data trends reports!), but we are a B2B SaaS company. Relative to B2C services, we might best be considered small but mighty :)
You are seeking an in-person work experience. Although there are hot spots of Ashby employees around the world, Ashby is a remote workplace. Rest assured, we do meet up in person for various events throughout the year!
You want to be on a large team of analysts. The data team at Ashby is extremely lean, so you will be primarily working with a data engineering partner, our first data analyst, and your manager (me!). That said, you will be working directly with many team members across the company, so your teammates in the analysis sense will be the diversity of folks you collaborate with from project to project.
Ashby's Data Stack
As it will undoubtedly be a point of interest, a quick summary of our data stack is provided here. Our production database is postgres, which we integrate into a Snowflake data warehouse via Polytomic. All other business systems are integrated via Fivetran (the GTM stack involves HubSpot as our CRM and Stripe, most notably). We use Prefect for orchestration and dbt for data modeling. Frontend event tracking is done via Rudderstack. Data visualization and reporting varies, but the broader company is primarily served standardized analytics via Looker. For version control we use Git/Github (and Github Actions for CI/CD). As an Analyst, you'll be at liberty to work in a notebook or tool of your choice, but Hex is the burgeoning standard and likely recommendation. Internal documentation lives in Slab and dbt docs.
A core part of the data stack at Ashby is the actual people! As mentioned, we are a lean team, and the current structure is myself as the manager, a single data engineer and a single data analyst. You would be our second data analyst joining the team, meaning you would represent the first step in scaling data practices and throughput. It also means that the role will necessitate a strong sense of ownership. The broader responsibility comes with broader leeway.
Interview Process
Our interview process is thorough. We aim to ensure each person that joins the team is the right fit for Ashby and will provide ample information for you to assess if Ashby is the right fit for you. The process for this role is as follows:
Hiring Manager Screen (30 mins)
Take Home Assignment: Mini Analysis and Write-up (~3-4 hours)
Final Round - Virtual Onsite (~2.5, can be split into multiple days)
(45 mins) Analysis Projects Deep Dive
(30 mins) Working with Product Stakeholders
(30 mins) Working with Go-to-Market Stakeholders

Note: please do not reach out to the broader Ashby team requesting more information or time to connect. We will diligently review all applications in detail after the public posting period is over.
Benefits
Competitive salary and equity.
10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.
Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it 😅.
Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US. We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.
